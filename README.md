Hi! Professionally I am an engineer who is fortunate enough to focus most of his time towards solving problems that arise from backend feature development and greenfield cloud architecture. 

Personally, I consider myself a technologist with a curious interest in understanding "how things work". Sometimes that is writing out Ohm's Law on a napkin to quickly figure out what resistance is needed for a desired base current, other times it is trying to get Rust compiled on a CI runner box to compare ruff against pylint,
drawing a dozen workflows and object models attempting to identify a pattern, ...I hope you see where I am going :) 

After many years of openly sharing small side projects, weekend hackathons, repositories of notes, evenings tinkering with new libraries/frameworks, etc, I've made the decision to privatize or entirely remove my repositories here. 

**If this impacts you in any way please feel free to reach out**. There were not any public repos that were overly impressive and the only repo actively used by someone else, to my knowledge, was the Flask kickstarter repo.
